This is an IOS app based on Swift programming language. It is basically a diary application for students to keep a track of 
their weekly assignments assigned by the professors. The student has to enter the date on which the task was assigned, the
deadline of the assignment and the details of the task, a basic description. After pressing "Add Task" button, the app will save
the details entered by the student in Google firebase using the firebase RESTful APIs.
